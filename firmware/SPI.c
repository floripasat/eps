 * Configures port 8 pins 1, 2 and 3 as SPI CLK, MOSI and MISO, repectively. Then configures port 8 pins 1, 2, 4, 5, 6 as output. Pin 4 is used as the ADS1248 reset, pin 5 as the
 * ADS1248 reset and pin 6 as the ADS1248 start. Then sets the UCWRST bit in the UCA1CTL1 register to allow configuration of the UCA1. Then configures it in the UCA1CTL0 register as
 * 3-pin SPI in master mode. Also sets the UCSYNC bit to signal a synchronous protocol. Then selects the clock source as the SMCLK (32 MHz), and configures UCA1BR0 as 0x08 and
 * UCA1BR1 and UCA1MCTL as 0x00, resulting in 4 a MHz clock for the SPI peripheral. Then clears the UCSWRST bit in the UCA1CTL1 register to resume normal operation.
